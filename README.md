On a side note, this project is meant to help me learn how to do a bunch of different things:
- Using multiple programming languages in collaboration
- Traversing and managing Windows files using code
- Creating GUI using Python's standard Tkinter library
- Compiling different file types together into single binaries
- Exploring various GitHub tools
